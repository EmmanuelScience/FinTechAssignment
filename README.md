Programming Assignment

This main purpose of this program is to analyse the sentiment score of some 8-K filings.
The main script is called main.py in the src folder.

I  did not take an OOP approach to solve this problem as I felt it was not necessary.

There are several csv files generated and a time series plot saved as png.
- CIK_date: contains all CIKs and their date
- 8-k_filings_sentiment score: contains CIK, date, Sentiment score and year(used for descriptive analysis) .
- descriptive_stat: contains descriptive analysis of each year
- time_series_plot.csv: contains two columns that will be used for the plot; year and sentiment score
- time_series.png: time series plot

A requirement.txt file is included. This contains the packages that are required for the program to run.
